## üí° Motivation 

The Compose Compiler plugin can generate reports / metrics around certain compose-specific concepts that can be useful to understand what is happening with some of your compose code at a fine-grained level.
[_**See this**_](https://github.com/androidx/androidx/blob/androidx-main/compose/compiler/design/compiler-metrics.md).  

This generates reports in `json`, `csv` and `txt` files which are not easily trace-able for developers.
Also, Composable function and class reports becomes large and tedious to check.
This tool parses the reports and metrics generated by Compose compiler and beautifies into a HTML page and intelligently distinguishes problematic and non-problematic composable functions and classes.

_This utility doesn't generate Compose Metrics and Reports. First, raw Compose report should be generated from the Compiler and those generated files should be feed to this utility. By parsing that data, this utility generates the beautified report._

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

First, install the CLI utility

### 1. Install CLI

To install the CLI utility, there are two ways

#### 1.1 Directly use `.jar` distribution

Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/compose-report-to-html/releases) and download the latest JAR artifact.

#### 1.2 Install from NPM

Install the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compose-report2html) for CLI utility.

```shell
npm install -g compose-report2html
```

### 2. Know usage

Run the commands to know the usage of CLI

#### 2.1 If using JAR artifact

```shell
java -jar composeReport2Html.jar -h
```

#### 2.2 If using NPM package

If you have installed CLI utility from NPM package, it can be directly available from Terminal.

```shell
composeReport2Html -h
```

Once you run, here's how it looks.

```shell
Usage: Compose Compiler Report to HTML Generator options_list
Options:
    --applicationName, -app -> Application name (To be displayed in the report) (always required) { String }
    --overallStatsFile, -overallStatsReport -> Overall Statistics Metrics JSON file (always required) { String }
    --detailedStatsFile, -detailedStatsMetrics -> Detailed Statistics Metrics CSV file (always required) { String }
    --composableMetricsFile, -composableMetrics -> Composable Metrics TXT file (always required) { String }
    --classMetricsFile, -classMetrics -> Class Metrics TXT file (always required) { String }
    --outputDirectory, -o -> Output directory name (always required) { String }
    --help, -h -> Usage info
```

### 3. Generate report

Make sure to generate Compose compiler metrics and reports as mentioned [here](https://github.com/androidx/androidx/blob/androidx-main/compose/compiler/design/compiler-metrics.md) or [this good read article by Chris Banes](https://chris.banes.dev/composable-metrics/). These files are then needed to this CLI utility to feed the data.

To generate the report, provide details related to app, metric and report files and output directory.

```shell
java -jar composeReport2Html.jar \
  -app <YOUR_APP_NAME> \
  -overallStatsReport <PATH TO *-module.json FILE> \
  -detailedStatsMetrics <PATH TO *-composables.csv FILE> \
  -composableMetrics <PATH TO *-composables.txt FILE> \
  -classMetrics <PATH TO *-classes.txt FILE> \
  -o <OUTPUT DIRECTORY PATH FOR REPORT>
```

OR, directly use `composeReport2Html` (_if using NPM package_).

***Example Usage:***

```shell
java -jar composeReport2Html.jar \
  -app NotyKT \
  -overallStatsReport app_release-module.json \
  -detailedStatsMetrics app_release-composables.csv \
  -composableMetrics app_release-composables.txt \
  -classMetrics app_release-classes.txt \
  -o notyReport
```

In the above example, it will create report with name **"NotyKT"** with specified metric and report files and finally report will be generated in the specified path i.e. `notyReport/index.html`.

## üìà Report Overview 

Once report is generated, it looks like this.

| **Title**               | **Preview**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brief Statistics**    | Generates metrics from `.json` file and represents in tabular format. <br><br> ![Brief Statistics](images/brief-stats.png)                                                                            |
| **Detailed Statistics** | Generates report from `.csv` file and represents in tabular format. <br><br> ![Detailed Statistics](images/detailed-stats.png)                                                                        |
| **Composable Report**   | Parses `-composables.txt` file and separates out composables with and without issues and properly highlights issues associated with them. <br><br> ![Composable Report](images/composable-report.png) |
| **Class Report**        | Parses `-classes.txt` file and separates out stable and unstable classes out of it and properly highlights issues associated with them. <br><br> ![Class Report](images/class-report.png)             |

Right now, work is in progress and more improvements related to the report
will happen in some time. If you have any feedback / suggestions related to 
the report, feel free to discuss it (_find discussion link in the below section_).

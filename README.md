## üí° Motivation 

The Compose Compiler plugin can generate reports / metrics around certain compose-specific concepts that can be useful to understand what is happening with some of your compose code at a fine-grained level.
[_**See this**_](https://github.com/androidx/androidx/blob/androidx-main/compose/compiler/design/compiler-metrics.md).  

This generates reports in `json`, `csv` and `txt` files which are not easily trace-able for developers.
Also, Composable function and class reports becomes large and tedious to check.
This tool parses the reports and metrics generated by Compose compiler and beautifies into a HTML page by intelligently distinguishes problematic and non-problematic composable functions and classes.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

First, install the CLI utility

### 1. Install CLI

To install the CLI utility, there are two ways

#### 1.1 Directly use `.jar` distribution

Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/compose-report-to-html/releases) and download the latest JAR artifact.

#### 1.2 Install from NPM

Install the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compose-report2html) for CLI utility.

```shell
npm install -g compose-report2html
```

### 2. Know usage

Run the commands to know the usage of CLI

#### 2.1 If using JAR artifact

```shell
java -jar composeReport2Html.jar -h
```

#### 2.2 If using NPM package

If you have installed CLI utility from NPM package, it can be directly available from Terminal.

```shell
composeReport2Html.jar -h
```

Once you run, here's how it looks.

```shell
Usage: Compose Compiler Report to HTML Generator options_list
Options:
    --applicationName, -app -> Application name (To be displayed in the report) (always required) { String }
    --overallStatsFile, -overallStatsReport -> Overall Statistics Metrics JSON file (always required) { String }
    --detailedStatsFile, -detailedStatsMetrics -> Detailed Statistics Metrics CSV file (always required) { String }
    --composableMetricsFile, -composableMetrics -> Composable Metrics TXT file (always required) { String }
    --classMetricsFile, -classMetrics -> Class Metrics TXT file (always required) { String }
    --outputDirectory, -o -> Output directory name (always required) { String }
    --help, -h -> Usage info
```

### 3. Generate report

```shell
java -jar composeReport2Html.jar \
  -app <YOUR_APP_NAME> \
  -overallStatsReport <PATH TO *-module.json FILE> \
  -detailedStatsMetrics <PATH TO *-composables.csv FILE> \
  -composableMetrics <PATH TO *-composables.txt FILE> \
  -classMetrics <PATH TO *-classes.txt FILE> \
  -o <OUTPUT DIRECTORY PATH FOR REPORT>
```

***Example Usage:***

```shell
java -jar composeReport2Html.jar \
  -app NotyKT \
  -overallStatsReport app_release-module.json \
  -detailedStatsMetrics app_release-composables.csv \
  -composableMetrics app_release-composables.txt \
  -classMetrics app_release-classes.txt \
  -o notyReport
```

In the above example, it will create report with name **"NotyKT"** with specified metric and report files and finally report will be generated in the specified path i.e. `notyReport/index.html`.

## üìà Report Overview 

Once report is generated, it looks like this

| **Title**               | **Comments**                                                                                                                              | **Demo**                                           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Brief Statistics**    | Generates metrics from `.json` file and represents in tabular format.                                                                     | ![Brief Statistics](images/brief-stats.png)        |
| **Detailed Statistics** | Generates report from `.csv` file and represents in tabular format.                                                                       | ![Detailed Statistics](images/detailed-stats.png)  |
| **Composable Report**   | Parses `-composables.txt` file and separates out composables with and without issues and properly highlights issues associated with them. | ![Composable Report](images/composable-report.png) |
| **Class Report**        | Parses `-classes.txt` file and separates out stable and unstable classes out of it and properly highlights issues associated with them.   | ![Class Report](images/class-report.png)           |
